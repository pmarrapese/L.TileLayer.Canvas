# L.TileLayer.Canvas
Render Leaflet tiles using `<canvas>` elements.

## Why?
If your project has a lot of layers, performance issues related to the GPU may sometimes occur. In our case, the easiest way to avoid them is to display map tiles not as `<img>` elements, but by drawing them on a `<canvas>`. Just take a look.

## How to use it?
You can install it via a package manager:
```
npm install tilelayer-canvas
```
or
```
yarn add tilelayer-canvas
```
or just copy `index.min.js` from this repository and include it using a `<script>` tag:
```js
<script src="./path/to/index.min.js"></script>
```

Then in your project use `L.tileLayer.canvas` instead of `L.tileLayer`. That's it! [See an example](./example/index.html).
